- [Forte Labs: The Throughput of Learning](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-throughput-of-learning/) Thoughtful essay on learning and for which aspects to optimize the systems we use to do it.
  > Our design problem, at least, is clear: we have to design our mental environment to maximize the throughput of invalidated assumptions, accelerating it to the point that the rules of our learning process break, thereby surfacing even more assumptions, which we can exploit to further improve this process.

  > just enough information to allow us to steer: toward discomfort, toward fear, toward our best guess of where the next bottleneck may lie
- [Weekend University: Annie Murphy Paul: The Extended Mind](https://youtube.com/watch?v=e4RW_skcup4) The author gives a concise overview of her work.
- [Anne-Laure Le Cunff: 25 Reasons to Write Online](https://nesslabs.com/online-writing) Inspiring.
- [Forte Labs: How To Take Smart Notes: 10 Principles to Revolutionize Your Note-Taking and Writing](https://fortelabs.com/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/) Based on Ahren's book "How To Take Smart Notes". Walks us through [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) then tries to derive universal principles. Always good to challenge your basics from time to time.
- [Ken Mogi: The little book of Ikigai](https://search.worldcat.org/title/little-book-of-ikigai-the-essential-japanese-way-to-finding-your-purpose-in-life/oclc/1002177118) Finished this as an audiobook. Less stringent than I would have liked at first but the pace is fitting for the topic. Feel-well book for autumn walks.
- [MJ Dorian: Creative Codex: 47: William Blake, On Visionâ€™s Wing Part 1: The Marriage of Heaven & Hell](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/49-william-blake-on-visions-wing-part-3-the-gods/id1430850607?i=1000678518546) Opinionated and personal look at William Blake's pantheon and how it's positioned in his oeuvre. A bit dreamy and weird, as usual. [Part 1](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/47-william-blake-on-visions-wing-part-1-the-marriage/id1430850607?i=1000664584358), [Part 2](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/48-william-blake-on-visions-wing-part-2-innocence-experience/id1430850607?i=1000671273344).
