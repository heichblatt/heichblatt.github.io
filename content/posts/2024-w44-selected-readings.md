- [Kottke: Walt Disney’s Corporate Strategy Chart](https://kottke.org/24/10/walt-disneys-corporate-strategy-chart-1)
  Think what you want about the company, I doubt many companies could express their strategy and vision as clearly as this, even if their life depended on it. And it always does.
- [Satya Nadella AI Tour Keynote: London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkDTvsUuWA)
  {{< youtube kOkDTvsUuWA >}}
  Microsoft has one of the clearest strategies when it comes to enabling actually productive everyday use of LLMs in the modern workplace. I'm not using their products much, but I enjoy them expressing and implementing a clear story and a lot of correct strategic thinking behind it.
- [Photoshoot Outtakes of Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood for Fleetwood Mac´s "Rumours" Album Cover, 1976](https://www.vintag.es/2024/10/rumours-outtakes.html)
  What's now iconic was once an experiment, unsure of its final form.
- [18 Life-Learnings from 18 Years of The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/10/22/marginalian-18/)
  So much excellent thinking in this, but one thing stood out to me.
  > How you love, how you give, and how you suffer is just about the sum of who you are.
- [Simon Willison: Notes on the new Claude analysis JavaScript code execution tool](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/24/claude-analysis-tool/)
  This is an example of what I meant in [Lenses](posts/2024-10-24-lenses/). In this case, build a visualization of dependencies from a given TOML-based lockfile. Apart from the LLM building a parser for the format on the fly, this is a prime example of pushing the work of constructing a mental model from the human to the machine, a kind of [shift left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) as described by [Larry Smith](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/500399.500404).
- Podcast: [Creative Codex](https://mjdorian.com/codex/)
  Loved so many episodes of this. Started with the ones about Leonardo da Vinci. A bit weird but I haven't come across a single boring episode.
- [Meta Releases NotebookLlama](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/meta-releases-notebookllama-v8cK.jRERmyT_hir4_ZT3g)
  Love the idea, but I currently do not have 140 GB of RAM lying around. Shows once again how strong Meta is in this space.
- [Does the O-Ring model hold for AIs?](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/10/does-the-o-ring-model-hold-for-ais.html)
  > The model, in short, says a production process is no better than its weakest link.
  
  I don't feel like mainstream LLMs are there yet, but an interesting problem to think about and it was nice to be reminded of the O-ring model.
- [When Your Product Is What It Is](https://spyglass.org/joan-of-arc/)
  Arc is the first browser I really enjoyed using in a long time. I trust the company behind it and have so far not been disappointed. They take their open communication approach seriously and their playfulness never felt forced. Feeling a little anxious what will happen to Arc, though.
- [Kourosh Dini: I can’t do what helps me](https://www.kouroshdini.com/i-cant-do-what-helps-me/)
  Dini describes a pattern I've noticed myself: People often reject helpful tools out of shame or fear of seeming "weak." He highlights that avoidance can stem from a reluctance to confront these feelings. Dini suggests overcoming this by gradually building trust through "visits," small, manageable actions that help alleviate overwhelm and cultivate self-compassion. His writing often revolves around this concept, he described in [The Visit and the Waves of Focus](https://www.kouroshdini.com/the-visit-and-the-waves-of-focus/).

- [Omnivore shutting down](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/details-on-omnivore-shutting-down) It's a shame, Omnivore was the best read-it-later service I ever used. After testing Wallabag for two days, I'm back on [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com).
- [Ness Labs: Plus Minus Next Journaling](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) Surprisingly effective. If you do not currently have a professional reflection routine, this is a good starting point.
- ["Presence" Trailer – Steven Soderbergh's Unconventional Haunted House Horror Movie](https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3837935/presence-trailer-steven-soderberghs-unconventional-haunted-house-horror-movie/) Looking forward to this. So many genre redefining movies these last couple of years, opening new vistas on the genre.
- [Introducing ChatGPT search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/) Nice addition, but I'll keep using [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) for making first inquiries into new topics. Seems to be more aimed at everyday use and not academic.
- [What a beautiful idea Mass-Observation is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-Observation)
  > Mass-Observation is a United Kingdom social research project (..) aimed to record everyday life in Britain through a panel of around 500 untrained volunteer observers who either maintained diaries or replied to open-ended questionnaires (known as directives).

- Songs of the Week:
  - Linkin Park: Over Each Other
    {{< youtube fSHoePrnmMw >}}
    I love the new Linkin Park and enjoyed each of the three releasese so far. Amazing to see how they managed their reboot.
  - Slipknot: Nero Forte
