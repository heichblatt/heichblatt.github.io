- [Stephen R. Covey: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) Finally got around to this classic. Impressed by both its far-reaching scope and comprehensive perspective, as well as its incredibly profound depth of insight. This truly has earned its status as a classic.
- [Le Cunff: Self-education: how to leverage the end of credentialism](https://nesslabs.com/self-education) Interesting ideas. I'm often surprised how little people in the ops space think about their own education. Don't ignore the gap between non-directed fiddling with tech and work-mandated training. Go about educating yourself in a structured manner. You are probably overestimating the effort necessary.
- [Le Cunff: The MoSCoW method of prioritization](https://nesslabs.com/moscow-method) Well written primer on the topic. Pairs well with the [Eisenhower matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method).
- Podcast [SWR Das Wissen: "Die neuen Kriege und ihre tieferen Ursachen"](https://www.swr.de/swrkultur/wissen/die-neuen-kriege-und-ihre-tieferen-ursachen-das-wissen-2025-01-12-102.html) Erhellend, wenn auch wenig optimistisch.
- Podcast [Future of Coding: Devine Lu Linvega - Making Your Own Tools](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/044.html) I've been following [100rabbits](https://100r.co/) for quite a while and adore their dedication. I admire the reasoning and philosophy, even if I wholeheartedly disagree with most of it. Tech culture could use many more of such extreme outliers.
- [38C3: Fnord-Nachrichtenr√ºckblick 2024](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-fnord-nachrichtenrckblick-2024) Thanks to atoth for making Fefe's negativity almost bearable.
- [Carol Dweck: A Summary of Growth and Fixed Mindsets](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/) Good refresher on the book. Extremely well summarized.
- [Des Traynor: The first rule of prioritization: No snacking](https://www.intercom.com/blog/first-rule-prioritization-no-snacking/) Came across the concept of snacking in [Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/book/) but once you know it, you can't help to see it everywhere. Extremely useful in self-improvement.
- [Austin Kleon: Comfort Work](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/comfort-work) The inverse of snacking. Paradoxically, equally important.
