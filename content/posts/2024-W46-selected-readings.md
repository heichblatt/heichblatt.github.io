- [Tiago Forte: Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.com/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes-3459b257d3eb) Favorite of the week. Distilling insights from notes by returning to them periodically to summarize them. See also parts [2](https://fortelabs.com/progressive-summarization-ii-examples-and-metaphors-5f9b8b7108df), [3](https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-iii-guidelines-and-principles/), [4](https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-iv-compressing-all-types-of-media-4dff7f6f27e8/), [5](https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-v-the-faster-you-forget-the-faster-you-learn/) and [6](https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-vi-core-principles-of-knowledge-capture/).
- [Shawn Wang: Big L Notation](https://www.swyx.io/big-l-notation) A model of mapping learning styles to outcomes, similar to Big O Notation. Simplified but useful.
- [Shawn Wang: Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) A short but pointed appeal to push yourself to ignore your procrastination disguised as misdirected stagefright to learn in public, really the most efficient way to do it anyway.
- [Shawn Wang: Eponymous Laws](https://www.swyx.io/eponymous-laws) I love such lists.
- [Huberman Lab: Dr. Allan Schore: How Relationships Shape Your Brain](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-allan-schore-how-relationships-shape-your-brain) Fascinating interview, touching on psychology, neurology, attachment theory and relationships.
  > but I don't think that most people know that. They assume somehow that there's circuitry in our brain and body for adult romantic attachment that is distinct from our attachment circuitry that we had with our parent. (..) your work speaks very loudly that they are, in fact, the exact same circuitry.
- Currently reading [Greg McKeown: Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://gregmckeown.com/books/essentialism/) I re-read this every couple of years.
