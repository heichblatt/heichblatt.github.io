Daniel Miessler's [Unsupervised Learning newsletter No. 363](https://danielmiessler.com/podcast/no-363-frontview-mirror-2023-edition/) was the final kick I needed to restart this blog.

I changed a couple of things on this website

* I switched from Jekyll to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). I use the [Minimal theme](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini).
* I removed a lot of blog posts. [archive.org still has them, if you need them.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210916112113/https://heichblatt.keybase.pub/)
