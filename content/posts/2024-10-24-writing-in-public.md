Daniel Miessler's [Unsupervised Learning newsletter No. 363](https://danielmiessler.com/podcast/no-363-frontview-mirror-2023-edition/) was the final kick I needed to restart this blog.

>  Buy a domain and start a blog. Not just a blog, but a website. A digital presence.
> 1. If you already have one, make sure it's on your own domain, and get everything you do digitally to emanate from your own site.
> 2. Commit to writing more. You don't have to take selfies with your food and become an "influencer". Just be yourself, in public, to whatever degree makes you comfortable.

> This is the year people need to break their reliance on companies for their identity. You are not an employee; you're a human. And I want to hear from you.

I changed a couple of things on this website

- I switched from Jekyll to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). I use the [Paper theme](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper).
- The website is now hosted on GitLab.com via [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).
- I removed a lot of blog posts. [archive.org still has them, if you need them.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210916112113/https://heichblatt.keybase.pub/)
