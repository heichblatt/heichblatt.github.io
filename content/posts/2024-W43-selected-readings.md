- [Jabra: Great ExpectAItions, Work in the age of AI](https://www.jabra.com/de-de/thought-leadership/ai-at-work)
  Interesting data about the current state of AI adoption in the workplace, some interesting findings when looking at different age groups.
- [Against /tmp](https://dotat.at/@/2024-10-22-tmp.html)
  A well-written list of arguments against a centralized `/tmp` that includes a historic perspective on the situation. I wish more technical essays would include the historical context and reasoning for the described shortcomings.
- [2024 Self-Host User Survey Results](https://selfh.st/survey/2024-results/)
- [Drew Breunig: The 3 AI Use Cases: Gods, Interns, and Cogs](https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/10/18/the-3-ai-use-cases-gods-interns-and-cogs.html)
  > Gods: Super-intelligent, artificial entities that do things autonomously.
  > Interns: Supervised copilots that collaborate with experts, focusing on grunt work.
  > Cogs: Functions optimized to perform a single task extremely well, usually as part of a pipeline or interface.
- [DistroWatch Weekly: Atomic systems vs immutable distributions](https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20241021#qa)
  Distrowatch explains the difference between atomic and immutable distros. It’s the first time I’m reading a naming of the concepts. It’s better this way than seeing the atomic approach as an inadequate attempt of the immutable approach.
- [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
  I’m currently extremely impressed by NotebookLM. A little like Perplexity, but in a notebook form similar to Jupyter, and you can generate a podcast from sources where topics or specific aspects are discussed between two hosts. You can incorporate various sources and then dissect/edit/etc. them in a notebook. To be honest, I would use it just for the podcast feature.
- [Figma Blog: The VS Code Method: Tightening a developer’s inner loop](https://www.figma.com/blog/the-vs-code-method-inner-loop/)
  Well-written disection of the concepts behind VSCode's design philosophy.
- [Fonts in Use: BND Recruitment Campaign](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/63455/bnd-recruitment-campaign)
- [Spiritbox "Soft Spine" ft. Poppy - Live from Louder Than Life](https://youtu.be/mMpEN2Jv7xM) This video made me realize what FPV drones are doing to concert footage.
