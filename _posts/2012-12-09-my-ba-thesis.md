I found my first reviser for my bachelor thesis. It is [Prof. Dr.
Joachim Schwend](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~culture/mitarb_schwend.htm)
and I'm very relieved he accepted. Hopefully, I will find my second
reviser next week so I can finish the registration until 18 December.

The thesis will fall into cultural studies. There is no concrete (as in
written in stone) question yet but the direction has become very clear
during the last few weeks.

I want to survey the anti-islamic movement within the New Right.
Specifically, I want to give a short overview of the scenes in the UK
and Germany and subsume them under the overarching model of
[Group-Focused
Enmity](http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/ikg/projekte/GMF/index.htm)
developed by the Institut für interdisziplinäre Konflikt- und
Gewaltforschung at Bielefeld University.

I'm still in the process of developing a detailed outline but one thing
is as sure as can be at this point: I want to tackle this project with
the familiar tools from software development. There is a public [Github
repository](https://github.com/heichblatt/ba-thesis) that holds the
public branch of my Git repository. There will be monthly point
releases, then two release candidates before the final version at the
beginning of June. Task management is done in
[Redmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmine). The resulting document
will be written in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and
bibliography will be managed in
[BibTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX).

Wish me luck as I tend to need it. The motto is: *Hoc age. Hora fugit.*

**Update:** [Rita
Singer](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~culture/mitarb_singer.htm) will be my
second reviser.

**Update:** I handed in the registration form. It's official now, folks,
and the baby has a (vaguely phrased) title: *The Anti-Islamic Movement
within the New Right*
