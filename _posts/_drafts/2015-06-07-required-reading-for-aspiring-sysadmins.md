I recommend you let these texts influence you.

## Big Picture

* [Thomas A. Limoncelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Limoncelli) et al.: [The Practice of System and Network Administration](http://everythingsysadmin.com/books.html#tposana): Your most important book. Your standard reference.
* [Thomas A. Limoncelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Limoncelli) et al.: [The Practice of Cloud System Administration](http://everythingsysadmin.com/books.html#tpocsa): As essential as its predecessor.

## Tools

* [Neal Stephenson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson): [In the Beginning was the Command Line](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html): the author compares ideological and philosophical differences between users of different user interfaces: graphical vs command line.
* [Drew Neil](http://drewneil.com/): [VimCasts](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/): Short videos introduce you to common operations in Vim.

## Culture

* [The Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/): Started as a glossary of hacker culture, but grew into an encyclopedia. Especially the [Introduction](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/pt01.html) and [Appendix B: A Portrait of J. Random Hacker](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html). Read about our shared roots.
* [Aaron Swartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz): [Be more productive](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity): If you ever need structure or motivation in your life, take some from a guy that had plenty.
