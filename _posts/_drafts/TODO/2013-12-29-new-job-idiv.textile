Recently, I've started to work for the "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)":http://www.idiv.de/idiv-global/?lang=en. It is a joint centre of the universities of Halle, Jena and Leipzig. I am part of a three-person IT support unit. In the near future the institute will consist of nearly 200 employees with challenging problems and tasks. I'm looking forward to interesting Linux-related problems and projects. Looking at the weeks already spent there, I don't regret my change of position.
