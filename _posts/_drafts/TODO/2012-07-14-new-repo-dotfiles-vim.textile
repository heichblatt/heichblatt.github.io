I've put up a new repository: "dotfiles-vim":https://github.com/heichblatt/dotfiles-vim. As you might have guessed, it contains my VIM config. I use "pathogen":https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen to manage my scripts etc and keep them unter @.vim/bundle/@ as "Git submodules":http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules. "There":http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/ "are":http://www.allenwei.cn/tips-using-git-submodule-keep-your-plugin-up-to-date/ "several":http://mirnazim.org/writings/vim-plugins-i-use/ "articles":http://dudarev.com/blog/keep-vim-settings-and-plugins-in-git-repo/ about this.
