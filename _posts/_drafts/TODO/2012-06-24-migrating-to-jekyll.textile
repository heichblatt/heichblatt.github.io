So I tried "jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and I liked it.

For quite a while now I have been wondering why I don't use some of the things I love working with for blogging: Git and Github. Guess I never got around to actually find a working solution that did not take ages to set up. Jekyll does not and since "Github Pages":https://github.com/pages is based on it, awesomeness ensues. There, I said it. The other thing is, even if Github is going down tomorrow, I can still generate HTML and push it to some server. You know, "freedom":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmJTcyqiZ44 and stuff. Lastly, I get to use my beloved "Textile":www.textism.com/tools/textile/.

So expect some migration of migration-worthy old posts during the next few days.

Oh yeah, and I switched to "English":http://ragefac.es/57.
