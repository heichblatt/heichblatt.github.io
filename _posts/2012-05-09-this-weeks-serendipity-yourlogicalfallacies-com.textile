The website with the motto "Thou shalt not commit logical fallacies" presents a nice overview over certain "logical fallacies":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Logical_fallacies with simple explanations, ready to be referenced in your next arguments.

Kind of like "ragefac.es":http://ragefac.es, just like, you know, intelligent and everything.
