I just "finished writing":https://github.com/heichblatt/klausur-globalisierung/tags my first exam from home. We had four hours time to answer a few questions with mini essays. However, as usual after exams, I am completely unsatisfied with it, but then again the questions were so broad that I don't even try to guess what will pass and what won't. It is remarkable how exhausted I am, even after this new kind of least effort exam.
Time to get dressed.

*Update:* Passed it, not exactly with flying colours, but still.
