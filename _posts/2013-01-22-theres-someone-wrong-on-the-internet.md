[found](http://caterina.net/2012/11/01/quarrel-not-at-all-or-why-one-shouldnt-engage-in-online-mudslinging/)
a great quote from Lincoln:

> “Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can
> spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take
> all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss
> of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more
> than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own.
> Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for
> the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.”

of the actual content.
