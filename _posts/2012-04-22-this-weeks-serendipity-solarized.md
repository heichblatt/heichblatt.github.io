I've been a long-time admirer of the [Zenburn colour
scheme](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburn/), but I have to admit:
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is my new favourite.
It comes in a bright and dark variants and configuration files for
various programs. What you don't find in [Schoonover's
repo](https://github.com/altercation/solarized), [can be found in
others](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=solarized&type=Everything&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1):
config files for
[awesome](https://github.com/cycojesus/awesome-solarized),
[Terminator](https://github.com/ghuntley/terminator-solarized) and GTK2
themes
([bright](https://github.com/heichblatt/gtk2-theme-solarizedlight) and
[dark](https://github.com/heichblatt/gtk2-theme-solarizeddark)).

**Update**: I just (20130615) stumbled across the AUR packages for my
repos
([light](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtk2-theme-solarizedlight-git/)
and
[dark](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtk2-theme-solarizeddark-git/),
thanks to [tlvince](https://github.com/tlvince) for this.
