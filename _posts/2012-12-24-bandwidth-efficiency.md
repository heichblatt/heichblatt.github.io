I stumbled across [Page Weight
Matters](http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters) by Chris
Zacharias where he briefly describes how he got a YouTube page down to
100 KB and the pain that caused him. He seems surprised to find that
reducing the fluff on such a widely known site as YT would actually
bring more people to the service, mostly those with slow internet
connections or from very remote places, people the average interwebz
citizen could maybe think about a little more often. If that's too lofty
for you, see it as an exercise in [minimalism](http://mnmlist.com/w/).

However, I was amused by the figures, still having much more restricting
rules in mind, specifically the [HTML Coding
Manifesto](http://web.archive.org/web/20040209204828/http://www.infested.de/old/archive/archive2.txt)
(in German). The authors (ca 2000) were still thinking about
compatibility with terminal browsers! After having thought for several
years that their benchmarks were a bit too strict, I am happy to see
their point made again, more than 10 years later.

Let's keep it short, shall we?

Now, may I interest you in a website that I always admired for its
completeness and simplicity, given its sole purpose, technical
documentation? [OpenBSD.org](http://openbsd.org)
